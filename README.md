# RFM-Analysis
This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis. The analysis was performed on an eCommerce dataset to derive actionable insights for targeted marketing and customer retention strategies.
1.Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, and ensured appropriate data types.

2.RFM Metrics Calculation:
Calculated Recency (days since the last purchase), Frequency (total orders), and Monetary value (total spending).

3.RFM Segmentation:
Assigned RFM scores using quartiles and combined them into an overall RFM score.

4.Customer Segmentation:
Applied clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means) to group customers into distinct segments based on RFM scores.

5.Segment Profiling:
Analyzed the characteristics of each customer segment to identify patterns and behaviors.

6.Marketing Recommendations:
Suggested tailored marketing strategies to improve customer retention and maximize revenue for each segment.

7.Visualizations:
Developed visualizations, including bar charts, scatter plots, and heat maps, to represent RFM distributions and clusters.

This project demonstrates the power of RFM analysis in deriving meaningful customer insights to drive data-driven business decisions.
